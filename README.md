Project Overview :

"This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts data from an external API, cleans and transforms the data, and then uses Apache Kafka for data streaming. 
The transformed data is processed using Apache Spark and subsequently stored in a MongoDB database for analysis and retrieval."
